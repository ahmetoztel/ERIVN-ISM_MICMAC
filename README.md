# ERIVN-ISM and MICMAC Analysis Tool

This repository provides a Python-based tool that performs full-scale **ERIVN-ISM** and **MICMAC analysis** on expert evaluations. The tool is designed for researchers and decision-makers who aim to analyze the interrelationships among factors using interval-valued neutrosophic logic and classify them based on their systemic roles.

---

## üß† What It Does

- Accepts expert evaluations in **linguistic SVNN format** from an Excel file.
- Aggregates expert opinions using the **Empirical Rule** to form **Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Numbers (IVNNs)**.
- Applies a **deneutrosophication** operator to generate a crisp decision matrix.
- Constructs:
  - Initial and Final Reachability Matrices
  - Hierarchical ISM structure with factor levels
  - MICMAC matrix with **Driving** and **Dependence** powers
- Classifies factors into:
  - **Driving**, **Dependent**, **Linkage**, and **Autonomous**
- Generates:
  - **MICMAC quadrant scatter plot**
  - **ISM level diagram** with directional arrows
- Exports all results to an Excel file (`ERIVN_ISM_MICMAC_Results.xlsx`)

---

## üìÅ Input Format

- The tool prompts the user to select an **Excel (.xlsx)** file.
- The file should contain **expert evaluations** stacked vertically. If there are `n` factors and `q` experts, the total number of rows should be `q √ó n`, each of `n` columns.
- Evaluations must be coded using linguistic scale values (e.g., 0 to 4), as mapped to SVNN values in the script.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `openpyxl`
   - `tkinter`
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Select your Excel file with expert inputs when prompted.
